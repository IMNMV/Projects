# Projects
A bank of projects I found fun and gave up on or I found fun and periodically update here as a backup.


The calculators were some fun projects I made when I wad first starting python and wanted to mimic calculators for expected utility theory and Bayseian analysis. 

Jarvis is a project for developing a robot assistant powered, for now, with Chat-GPT-4. Next is vision/constant environment feedback so it never "turns off". Continual work in progress.

There are some random functions that will be agents for Jarvis, eventually. Most have not been added to my GitHub.

The twitter bot detects logical fallacies decently, has some bugs but overall works. Gotta fix it with the new Twitter API update. Too lazy right now.

Currently working on enhancing the quality of executable tasks that can be performed through prompt engineering via contextual memory and other means (taking screen shots and explaining with OCR, executing code on its own in a bash shell, etc. See ChatBotQuarky for more. Continual work in progress.

The Document Diglet repository is a way to find relevant sections of a document. Basically, we're using Ctrl-F on transformers with MS MARCO Distillbert v4 from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-v4). In conjunction with the sentence transformers library, this enables us to create sentence embeddings. These embeddings can be queried for with cosine similarity when given a user's prompt. Continual work in progress.

Simulation World is a project to try out simulations under various conditions. Continual work in progress.

Agent V Agent is an exploration into simulations with LLMs. The plan is to give a 2+ ChatBots a goal in a given environment with rules to abide by and see the choices they make. Eventually this will be scaled up to test for other emergent properties. Continual work in progress.
