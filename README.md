# Projects
A bank of personal projects



The Bayesian calculators were some fun projects I made when I wad first starting python and wanted to mimic a calculator.

The NLP code is the beginning of my project where I want to take text I have made from audio and summarize it into various forms (bullet point, summary, etc.


Jarvis is my personal project for developing a robot assistant powered, for now, with Chat-GPT3, but eventually I would like to make my own NLP model to use.

For now, the goal of jarvis will be to give output of the chatgpt response in audio form. 
It will then write pure code responses as code (using exec()).
It will also be able to bypass its typical filters and give best guesses via prompt trickery ;)

^All of the above I have done so far with a raspberry pi, but since it corrupted I plan to re-do the project on my macbook. 

Next steps:

Facial recognition / movement integration
