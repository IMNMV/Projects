# Projects
A bank of projects I found fun and gave up on or I found fun and periodically update here as a backup.


The calculators were some fun projects I made when I wad first starting python and wanted to mimic calculators for expected utility theory and Bayseian analysis

Jarvis is my personal project for developing a robot assistant powered, for now, with Chat-GPT-4. That is in progress. Next is vision.

There are some random functions that will be agents for Jarvis, eventually.

The twitter bot detects logical fallacies decently. Gotta fix it with the new Twitter API update. Too lazy right now.

Currently working on enhancing the quality of executable tasks that can be performed through prompt engineering via contextual memory and other means. See ChatBotQuarky for more.

The Document Diglet is a way to find relevant sections of a document. Basically Ctrl-F on transformers. Work in progress.
