#Bayes Calculator taking into account 3 conditions

#In some instances we may need to take into account multiple conditionals.

#For example: Say there was a attitude poll conducted among 3 states about peoples' opinions towards covid-19 vaccines.
#In State A - 60% of people support taking a vaccine
#In State B - 75% of people support taking a vaccine
#In State C - 47% of people support taking a vaccine
#Of the TOTAL population comprising the 3 states:
#30% Live in State A
#46% Live in State B
#24% Live in State C

#One could naturally ask the question: What is the probability a person lives in State A given they support vaccines? P(H|D)
#This calculator can solve this problem. 
#The first conditional to be input in form P(D|H) will output P(H|D) taking into account the other two
#states and their attitudes.
#The answer to this particular example is 28%

#User input so the person can input their values. Keep in mind the conditional of interest is = what you want to find P(H|D) to be.
#Each prior probability, or the P(H) should be input following the relative conditional.

Likelihood1 = float(input("Hi! Enter the value equivalent to P(D|H) of Conditional 1: "))
H1 =   float(input("Enter the value equivalent to P(H) of Conditional 1: "))
Likelihood2 = float(input("Enter the value equivalent to P(D|H) of Conditional 2: "))
H2 =   float(input("Enter the value equivalent to P(H) of Conditional 2: "))
Likelihood3 = float(input("Enter the value equivalent to P(D|H) of Conditional 3: "))
H3 =   float(input("Enter the value equivalent to P(H) of Conditional 3: "))
