Calculator One: Eutility Calculator With Two Choices


#Say you're at a casino table and you've found yourself 3 hours and a few drinks in.
#Right now there is a game of 5 card draw going on and you're unsure about the situation you find yourself in.
#You currently stand to gain $5000 if you bet $400 worth of chips and win.
#You know there's a 4/44 chance the dealer will give you the one of the cards you need to win.
#You also know this means there is a 40/44 chance the dealer will NOT give you one of the cards you need to win
#This calculator takes in the utility of winning, losing, the probability of winning and losing and outputs
#The overall utility of the decision (bet). 

#You probably wouldn't be able to whip this bad boy out, but let's assume the casino has a soft spot today.


def EUTCalc(UWinning, ULosing, PWinning, PLosing):
    '''Takes 4 parameters: The overall utility of winning (or the outcome coming about), 
    the overall utility of losing (outcome not coming about), the probability of winning, 
    and the probability of losing. It then calculates this to help you make a decision'''
    
    UWin = UWinning
    ULose = ULosing
    PWin = PWinning
    PLose = PLosing
    
    Outcome = (UWin * PWin) + (ULose * PLose)
    
    return Outcome

EUT = EUTCalc(5000, -400, 4/44, 40/44) #Gambling example 
print("The expected utility of this decision is:", EUT)
if EUT == 0:
    print('EUT has no opinion.')
if EUT < 0:
    print('EUT says: "No thank you to this decision."')
if EUT > 0 and EUT < 10:
    print('EUT says: "The potential gain outweights the statistical risk."')
if EUT > 10:
    print('EUT says: "Go for it.")
#Output: The expected utility of this decision is: 90.90909090909093
EUT says: "Go for it."


Calculator Two:
#This calculator is more geared toward the outcome of two decisions, although the calculations are the same.
#If you want to decide between two options and you have a rough estimate of the overall utility each choice will provide and the probability of them occurring
#look no Further!

#The Hunger Dilemma:
Say eating a slice of pizza will make you happy, but you know you'll have to work out tomorrow to burn it off will give you 80 utils of happiness.
#The probability of this pizza making you happy AND you working out tomorrow is about 72%.

#On the other hand, eating some vegetables would satiate you, but you wouldn't be all that happy -- Although you wouldn't need to work out tomorrow. This = 56 utils
#The probability of the vegetables satiating you but not making you all that happy and not needing to work out is 85%.

What might expected utility theory tell us to do? Let's find out!


#These four lines of code take user input. Make sure to input the utility in whole number form and the probabilities in decimal form.
Choice1 = float(input("Hi! Enter Utility of Outcome 1 in whole number form: "))
PChoice1 =  float(input("Enter Probability of Outcome 1 in decimal form: "))
Choice2 =   float(input("Enter Utility of Outcome 2 in whole number form: "))
PChoice2 =  float(input("Enter Probability of Outcome 2 in decimal form: "))


def EUTCalc(*args):
    '''Takes 4 parameters: The overall utility of winning (or the outcome coming about), 
    the overall utility of losing (outcome not coming about), the probability of winning, 
    and the probability of losing. It then calculates this to help you make a decision'''
 
    
    UC1 = Choice1
    UC2 = Choice2
    PC1 = PChoice1
    PC2 = PChoice2
    
    Outcome1 = (UC1 * PC1)
    Outcome2 = (UC2 * PC2)
    if Outcome1 == Outcome2:
        print('EUT has no opinion. Try flipping a fair coin.')
    if Outcome1 < Outcome2:
        print('EUT says: "Outcome 2.')
    if Outcome1 > Outcome2:
        print('EUT says: "Outcome 1.')
    Answer = ['Outcome 1 with: ', Outcome1, 'utils VS Outcome 2 with:',  Outcome2, 'utils']
    
    
    return Answer

EUT = EUTCalc() 
print("The expected utility of this decision is:", EUT)

#Hunger Dilemma Output: EUT says: "Outcome 1.
The expected utility of this decision is: ['Outcome 1 with: ', 57.599999999999994, 'utils VS Outcome 2 with:', 47.6, 'utils']
#There we have it! Pizza time it is.
