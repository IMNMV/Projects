#this version of jarvis contains memory. It works, but it is extremellllyyyyyyy expensive to do API calls with this code. The reason being is that the amoount
#of money you pay per call is relative to the size of your prompt + your max tokens specified. Jarvis' memory is adding its previous output within the prompt
#which does what its supposed to, but has a limitation of 3k characters and the larger it is the more expensive it becomes. ~.50 per call at max prompt + 1k tokens
#so, in theory this is a cool way to have the API remmeber convos and interact in ways that recall past output, but its limite due to the nature of the API
#if one had their own NLP I wonder how this could work....hm....
